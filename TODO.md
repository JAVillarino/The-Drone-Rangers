Add the ability to make the cool looking ghost image of where the dots were over time. Then we can compare that between different algorithms.


Random Ideas:
- Two modes for frontend - one where you know you're interacting with a simulation backend, and one where you aren't. For the simulation backend, you have a bunch of additional features:
    - Ability to speed up / fast-forward time.
    - Ability to go back in time.
    - Ability to pause.


We should just be able to submit the benchmark on the scenarios for every weekly check-in. Hopefully we'll gradually improve, and we can gradually add more benchmarks.

Okay I'm actually going to finish out the benchmarks so we can submit them.
Okay we need to be able to run it a little bit faster so I'll only do one trial of each. The additional seed wasn't bringing much signal anyways. Then I need the ability to load in a specific trial.
