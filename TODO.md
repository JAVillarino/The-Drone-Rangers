Try to make the aversion work properly.




Random Ideas:
- Two modes for frontend - one where you know you're interacting with a simulation backend, and one where you aren't. For the simulation backend, you have a bunch of additional features:
    - Ability to speed up / fast-forward time.
    - Ability to go back in time.
    - Ability to pause.


We should just be able to submit the benchmark on the scenarios for every weekly check-in. Hopefully we'll gradually improve, and we can gradually add more benchmarks.
