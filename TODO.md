Okay, now see if I can run the demo. Once I get the demo working, I should see if I can run the overall backend.




Random Ideas:
- Two modes for frontend - one where you know you're interacting with a simulation backend, and one where you aren't. For the simulation backend, you have a bunch of additional features:
    - Ability to speed up / fast-forward time.
    - Ability to go back in time.
    - Ability to pause.
